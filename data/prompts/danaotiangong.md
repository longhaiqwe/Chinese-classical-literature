# 大闹天宫 (Havoc in Heaven) Image Prompts

## 1. 龙宫借宝 (Dragon Palace Borrowing Treasure)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Medium shot of Sun Wukong (Monkey King, pre-armor, rough fur clothes) standing in the underwater Dragon Palace. He looks unimpressed and bored, waving his hand dismissively at a pile of discarded high-quality weapons (swords, spears, tridents) offered by dragon soldiers. Background shows intricate coral structures and deep ocean blues sketched in loose ink. Bubbles and floating seaweed. Dim, mysterious underwater lighting with caustic patterns. Thick rough ink outlines. --ar 16:9

## 2. 定海神针 (The Golden Cudgel)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Low angle wide shot. The heavy iron pillar (Golden Cudgel) towers upwards, glowing with mysterious ancient gold runes, piercing the dark ocean depths. Sun Wukong stands at the base, looking tiny but ecstatic, reaching out to touch it. Turbulent water swirls around. High contrast between the dark abyss and the blinding gold light causing lens flares. Rough paper texture overlay. Dramatic scale. --ar 16:9

## 3. 地府销名 (Crossing Names in the Underworld)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Close-up intense shot. Sun Wukong (furious expression, eyes glowing red) slamming a brush onto a floating, ragged scroll (Book of Life and Death). Thick black ink splashes from the brush impact. Background is the gloomy, shadowy Hall of Yen-lo, with terrified judges cowering in the shadows. Eerie green and blue ghost lights. Heavy chairoscuro and aggressive cross-hatching. --ar 16:9

## 4. 官封弼马 (The Bimawen)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Eye-level shot. Sun Wukong wearing ill-fitting, minor celestial official robes, looking bored and annoyed, leaning against a cloud-fence. Behind him, majestic celestial horses graze on clouds. The setting is the Heavenly Stables, bright but rendered with gritty, dirty ink textures to show his dissatisfaction. Soft golden light but with deep, heavy shadows on Wukong's face indicating his suppressed ego. --ar 16:9

## 5. 蟠桃盛会 (The Peach Banquet)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Chaos scene. Sun Wukong (drunk, face flushed) sprawling on a Jade table, holding a massive wine jar. Scattered around him are half-eaten giant peaches and overturned platters. The background is the destroyed瑶池 (Jade Pool) banquet hall. Muted colors with splashes of intense peach pink and wine red. Dizzying, tilted camera angle. Heavy ink contours. --ar 16:9

## 6. 大战天兵 (Battle with Heavenly Army)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Epic action shot. Sun Wukong (now in full Golden Chain Mail armor) mid-air, striking a dynamic combat pose with the Golden Cudgel. Below and around him are clouds filled with thousands of celestial soldiers (silhouettes and glimmering armor). Explosive energy, swirling clouds, lightning. high contrast, dramatic side lighting. Sense of overwhelming scale and one-man-army power. --ar 16:9

## 7. 平行时空：平庸官僚 (Bad Ending: Boring Bureaucrat)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Melancholic medium shot. Sun Wukong sitting at a desk piled with paperwork in a sterile heavenly office. He looks aged, dull, and completely devoid of spirit. No armor, just plain official robes. Grey and beige color palette. Static, lifeless composition. A window shows a small glimpse of the free world far below, out of focus. --ar 16:9
