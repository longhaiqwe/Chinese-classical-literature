# 后羿射日 (Hou Yi Shoots the Suns) Image Prompts

## 1. 十日并出 (Ten Suns Rises)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Wide chaotic shot. The sky is blindingly bright with ten scorching suns arranged in an arc, burning the clouds away. The scorched earth below is cracked and dry. Withered trees silhouette against the intense heat. Rivers have dried up into mud beds. A crowd of ancient Chinese peasants in rags are kneeling or collapsing in despair, shielding their eyes. Heat haze distortion. Vivid oranges, yellows, and burnt browns. Rough, expressive ink lines. --ar 16:9

## 2. 帝尧之请 (Emperor Yao's Plea)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Medium shot using low angle. Emperor Yao (ancient royal robes, looking haggard and desperate) bows deeply to Hou Yi. Hou Yi stands tall and muscular, wearing tribal hunter leathers, holding a massive divine red bow (Tong Bow). They are on a high stone platform or mountain peak. The background is the relentless blinding sky. Strong contrast between the weary Emperor and the powerful, resolved Hero. Texture of heat and dust. --ar 16:9

## 3. 金乌顽劣 (The Mocking Crows)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Close-up intense shot. Ten three-legged Golden Crows (mythical birds wreathed in fire) flying in a chaotic circle. They are looking down with malicious, mocking expressions, spitting streams of divine fire. In the foreground, out of focus, is the tip of Hou Yi's arrow. The atmosphere is suffocatingly hot. Dynamic motion blur. Aggressive brush strokes. --ar 16:9

## 4. 九日坠落 (Nine Suns Falling)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Epic action freeze-frame. Hou Yi has just released an arrow (glowing white energy trail). In the sky, several suns are exploding or plummeting like meteors, trailing black smoke and dying flames. One Golden Crow is struck and disintegrating. The remaining suns are scattering in panic. Explosive composition. High contrast between the bright explosions and the darkening sky. Debris falling. --ar 16:9

## 5. 万物复苏 (All Things Reborn)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Wide peaceful shot. Only one gentle sun remains in the clear blue sky. Gentle rain is falling on the cracked earth, and small green shoots are instantly springing up. Hou Yi stands on a cliff, lowering his bow, looking out over the recovering land. People in the distance are cheering and dancing in the rain. Soft, cool color palette (blues, greens) contrasting with the previous heat. Atmosphere of relief and hope. --ar 16:9

## 6. 平行时空：黑暗永夜 (Bad Ending: Eternal Darkness)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Dark, cold atmosphere. A frozen wasteland under a starless pitch-black sky. No suns exist. Everything is covered in blue ice and snow. Hou Yi stands alone, shivering, frozen statue-like, holding his useless bow. Regretful expression. Monochromatic blue and black palette. Ghostly wind effects. --ar 16:9
