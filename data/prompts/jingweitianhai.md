# 精卫填海 (Jing Wei Fills the Sea) Image Prompts

## 1. 离家远游 (The Departure)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Wide shot. Young Nuwa (traditional ancient Chinese clothing, elegant but simple) standing on a high mountain cliff, looking out towards a distant, glowing horizon where the sun meets the sea. Morning mist swirls around pine trees. Soft, hopeful golden lighting. Traditional ink wash texture mixed with rough charcoal lines. --ar 16:9

## 2. 泛舟戏水 (Sailing the East Sea)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Eye-level medium shot. Nuwa on a small wooden boat in the middle of a vast, calm turquoise ocean. She is smiling, hand trailing in the water. The sky is clear blue with fluffy white clouds. Sparkles on the water surface. Sense of freedom and joy. Lighter ink strokes but still retaining the gritty texture. --ar 16:9

## 3. 风暴突袭 (The Sudden Storm)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Low angle dramatic shot. The sky has turned pitch black with jagged lightning. Massive, terrifying waves (stylized like claws) tower over the tiny wooden boat. Nuwa is gripping the rudder tightly, standing firm with a fierce, determined expression, fighting to control the boat against the wind. She looks brave and unyielding, not afraid. Dark, moody palette with flashes of lightning white and deep indigo. Heavy, chaotic ink splashes. --ar 16:9

## 4. 溺水化鸟 (The Transformation)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Underwater/Split-level shot. Below the surface, Nuwa's silhouette is sinking into the deep abyss, fading. Above the crashing waves, a glowing, translucent spirit is rising, taking the form of a white-beaked, red-footed bird (Jingwei). Mystical energy swirls around the bird. High contrast between the dark depths and the bright spirit. Ethereal glow. --ar 16:9

## 5. 衔石西山 (Carrying Stones from West Mountain)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Tracking shot. The Jingwei bird (white beak, red claws, determined look) flying against strong wind, carrying a small pebble or twig in its beak. Background shows the rugged Xi Shan (West Mountain) with ancient trees. Feathers look ruffled and worn. Muted earth tones with the bright red of the bird's claws standing out. Sense of exhaustion and grit. --ar 16:9

## 6. 千古誓言 (The Oath to the Ocean)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Confrontation perspective. The tiny Jingwei bird hovering in the air, facing a massive, personified wave face of the Ocean God that fills the background. The bird looks defiant, not afraid. The Ocean looks mocking but vast. Dramatic scale difference. Stormy atmosphere. Heavy chiaroscuro. --ar 16:9

## 7. 精神永存 (Eternal Spirit)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Symbolic composition. A silhouette of the Jingwei bird flying towards a setting sun, dropping a stone. The ocean below looks slightly calmer, filled with many stones creating a path. Warm, legendary amber and gold color palette. Rough paper texture. Timeless feel. --ar 16:9

## 8. 平行时空：安度一生 (Bad Ending: A Normal Life)
Gritty Chinese Manhua style. Peaceful medium shot. Nuwa, now an adult woman, weaving cloth in a farmhouse courtyard. She looks content but ordinary, with no spark in her eyes. Chickens picking at the ground. Warm but dull afternoon light. No vast ocean, just a closed-in courtyard walls. Static composition. --ar 16:9
